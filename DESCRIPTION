Description: An implementation of an extended verstion of the marginal sensitivity
    sensitivity model proposed by Qingyuan Zhao, Dylan S. Small and Bhaswar B.
    Bhattacharya (2019) in R. It can be used to perform sensitivity analysis of
    IPW estimates of causal effects in observational studies with binary as well
    as multivalued treatments. The magnitude of unmeasured confounding can be 
    specified using Risk Ratios or Odds Ratios between the observed propensity
    scores and the true (unobserved) propensity scores. Apart from the stabilised
    IPW (SIPW) estimators, a doubly robust augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator has also
    been implemented.
